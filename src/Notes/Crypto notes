E-Function, that encrypts M
D-Function, that decrypts C
K-Key

Def of Cryptography:
    The science and mathematics of transforming messages into "hidden" messages.
        1) Symmetric cryptography
            Sender and Receiver use the same key
        2) Asymmetric cryptography
            Sender and receiver use their own private key but also have public keys

Ex.
M = "attack"
C = "buubdl"
We shifted each character by 1.

M = "zoo"
C = "app"

M = "attack"
C = "nggnpx"
We shifted each character by 13

C = "wifx"
M = ""
